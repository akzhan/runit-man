## Installation

### Opscode Chef

We provide [runit-man cookbook](https://github.com/Undev/runit-man-cookbook) to automate setup of runit-man using [Opscode Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/).

### Manual installation

Usually You should install both **runit-man** and **thin** gems to run this tool fine.

```bash
gem install runit-man thin
```

Pragmatic approach is to setup runit-man as runit service like this:

```bash
runit-man -p 14500 -r
```

This command installs runit-man as runit service (using default folders `/etc/sv/` and `/etc/service/`).

Look at {file:INSTALL.md} for details.

### rackup configuration

Take a note that runit-man gem also provides config.ru rackup configuration file.
It's useful for running under unicorn/rainbows etc. `runit-man --rackup=command` option does `cd config.ru directory && set environment && exec command`.

## Customization

This tool can provide additional information or actions through it's Web page.

### View names and content of files that related to concrete service

For each known runit service this tool looks for `./runit-man/files-to-view/` folder.
Every symlink there will be shown as link to view target file content.

### Show links that related to concrete service

For each known runit service this tool looks for `./runit-man/urls-to-view/` folder.
Every file ended with .url will be shown as link to view target location (location should be written as content of this file).

### Indicate services with any of watched files are modified since service startup

For each known runit service this tool looks for `./runit-man/files-to-watch/` folder.
Symlink targets there will be tested for its mtime to be less than service start time.
Service will be indicated as dangerous (as red color) to restart if any watched file is modified since service startup.

### Show buttons that send signals to concrete service

For each known runit service this tool looks for `./runit-man/allowed-signals/` folder.
Each one-letter-named file declares that signal button should be shown in Web UI.

Signal letters listed below in REST API section.

## REST API

### Get state

You can read current state of services in [JSON format](http://www.json.org/ "JSON home page") using
`GET /services.json`

### Management

You can manage your services using
`POST /<service name>/<command>`

Supported commands: *up*, *down*, *restart*, *switch_up* (activates service), *switch_down* (deactivates service).

Note that to use this feature You must do logging using

```bash

```

#### logger

## Localization

Localization can be done by editing of `./i18n/*.yml` locale files.
Contributions are welcome.

## Development

Runit-man provides a useful Vagrant file.
To have a complete development environment:

* Grab [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) and [Oracle VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org/).
* Checkout submodules: `git submodule update --init`.
* Setup Vagrant box: `vagrant up`.

Now you have an Ubuntu 12.04 system with runit and runit-man running inside
your Vagrant box
